a crappy fibonacci program (the best i could do without arrays ðŸ˜„)

hi bhai
    bhai ye hai fib_num = 0;
    bhai ye hai curr = 1;
    bhai ye hai prev = 0;

    bol bhai 0;
    bol bhai 1;
    jab tak bhai (curr < 100) {
        fib_num = curr + prev;
        bol bhai fib_num;
        prev = curr;
        curr = fib_num;
    }
bye bhai
